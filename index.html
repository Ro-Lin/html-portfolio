  <h5>Titanic</h5>

  <p>
    Titanic, American romantic adventure film, released in 1997, that centres on the sinking of the RMS Titanic. The film
    proved immensely popular, holding the all-time box-office gross record for more than a decade after its release.
  </p>
  <p>
    James Cameron's "Titanic" is an epic, action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S.
    Titanic; the pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the time, the largest moving object ever built. She was the
    most luxurious liner of her era -- the "ship of dreams" -- which ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their death in
    the ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of April 15, 1912.

    Cusack and Kate Beckinsale.

  <p>
    On a magical night when they are in in their 20s, Jonathan (John Cusack) meets Sara (Kate Beckinsale). He finds it love at first sight, but Sara believes in destiny. After 10 years the two -- with 3,000 miles between them -- must decide if fate wants them to be together again. When love feels like magic, it is called destiny; when destiny has a sense of humor, it is serendipity.
